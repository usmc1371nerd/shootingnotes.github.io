This is a web application as a way to document shooting notes. I would like to eventually build this out to be a app that can be put on a phone. This is why I chose python for its ability to be able to handle a lot of computing data. The coding language is easy to learn as well and I can easily find help in the future.

The frameworks and languages used for this site is:

Python (used to extend websites templates to other places and where you see {%%} if and else statments as well)
HTML (used to code base.html)
CSS (addtional styling other than bootstrap set templates)
Bootstrap (a template)
JavaScript (used to call a delete function from the database)
SQL (database)
JSON (calling a delete functions and moving data for sign-up and logins)

The something new I learned:

Adding a sign-up page we did learn a log-in but a sign-up we did not.

JINJA2 (Templating language this is also my something new learned)

For now I knew I had to build a smaller app with some short of templating ability at first so I could manage this project on my own. I didn't make any wire frames but instead wrote and drew small little ideas to help drive my organization on my ideas. But with the timeline I knew in order to push a MVP to at least get the idea started. I would have to keep it simple so just a login and signup to control the info of each user and note taking for now will do. So to solve all these problems bootstrap, and jinja seemed like a great fit. I would then do any additional styling using CSS.
